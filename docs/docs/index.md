## extSearch documentation

extSearch is an open source framework for exploring extremal solutions to hard constrained optimisation problems.  
This site documents both the web UI and the underlying data model.

## Fit game

The **Fit** game is the first problem hosted on extSearch. It provides:

- **Interactive square packing UI** – drag, rotate, and delete squares on a large board.
- **Live metrics** – the current enclosing square side length is shown as you move pieces.
- **Submission pipeline** – layouts can be submitted to the backend for storage, validation, and later analysis.

For a deep dive into how the Fit frontend works (coordinate system, collision detection, pointer handling, and data export), see:

- [Fit game implementation (`fit.js`)](fit.md)

- Additional problem types and APIs will be documented in this section as the project grows.
